	I woke in a sterile white room, the kind of white that pressed against my skull and made everything ache. The cold and pervasive sensation that made my head throbbed as I raised upon the floor, my thoughts were scattered, and for a moment, I couldn’t remember anything ,not my name, not how I got here nor even why I was alive.

Beside me was a canvas bag, my hands shook as I reached for it, and inside were some unmarked bills, a key which is noticeably not for this apartment room . But more importantly, three Tarot cards: The Tower (XVI), The Hanged Man (Reversed), and The Moon (Upright).

Lightning struck the spire, people falling from its heights. My chest tightened. “I… I know this,” I whispered, though I didn’t know how I could. “I’ve seen it… somewhere… or… maybe it’s me.”

The key felt heavy in my hand, almost alive, pulsing like it knew its purpose. I stood and walked to the door, wincing as the pain in my head flared. The lock turned easily, almost too easily, and I stepped into a narrow corridor bathed in fluorescent light.

"Hello?" I called, my voice sounding foreign in the emptiness. No answer came, just the shuffle of my own shoes on the linoleum.

At the end of the hallway, a stairwell descended into darkness. I felt drawn to it, as if the Tower card itself was pulling me downward. I hesitated. “I must go… I must know what this means.”

My foot caught on a step, and I stumbled. The Tarot cards rattled in the bag. A flash of lightning shot through my mind, like the card had come alive. I clutched my head. “No… calm…”

I descended slowly, each step echoing, until I reached the exit doors. I felt a warmth spread through my chest—fear mixed with an odd sense of anticipation.

Outside, the city of Vespera stretched before me, cloaked in fog and neon glow. Shadows moved through the mist, silent, almost unreal. I took a hesitant step forward.

"Where… am I?" I muttered.

A voice answered from the fog, sharp and deliberate: “Lost, are we?”

I spun, clutching the cards like a lifeline. A tall figure emerged, draped in a dark coat, their face hidden in shadow.

"Who… who are you?" I asked, my voice barely steady.

"Names are meaningless here," they said, their voice strange, echoing. "But the Tower… you already hold your fate in your hands. Do not ignore the fall."

"I don’t understand… What fall?" I pressed.

The figure tilted their head, studying me. “You will. Every collapse begins somewhere. Remember, the cards are not just images… they are mirrors. And mirrors… lie only when you do.”

Before I could respond, the figure melted into the fog. I was alone again, staring at the Tower card in my hand. The lightning on it seemed to burn.

"Mirrors… lie only when you do," I whispered, repeating the words as if speaking to them aloud might help me understand.

I slid the cards back into the bag, gripped the key, and started walking into the unknown city. Each step felt like a drumbeat in my chest, echoing the warning of the Tower. My journey had begun—and I had no idea if I was ready for what awaited me.
