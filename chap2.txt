    The fog of Vespera seemed endless as I wandered through narrow streets, neon signs flickering above closed shops. My head still throbbed, but the Tower card burned in my pocket, a constant reminder that my past—or whatever fragments remained—was gone. I had no idea where I was going, only that something, some invisible thread, pulled me forward.

Eventually, I found myself in front of a small, shadowed shop: The Cloak and The Quill. The windows were fogged and dusty, and the bell above the door jingled nervously as I entered.

Inside, the air smelled of old paper, candle wax, and something more elusive knowledge, perhaps, or secrets better left buried. The shop was dimly lit, shelves stacked with leather-bound books that seemed older than the city itself.

"I… I’m looking for… something," I said, my voice trembling.

"Looking for something, are you?" A voice responded, soft but sharp. I turned, and there she was—Madame Zora. Her eyes were impossibly dark, seeming to look through me, not at me. “Or perhaps it’s looking for you,” she said.

I swallowed. “I don’t know… I just… I found these cards.” I pulled the Tower, Hanged Man, and Moon cards from my bag, laying them gently on the counter.

Her eyes widened almost imperceptibly, and she leaned closer, whispering, “The prophecy is upon you. You are… chosen, though I do not know why. But the cards… the cards are a map, and a warning.”

"Map? Warning?" My hands shook. “I don’t even remember who I am… how am I supposed to understand this?”

She nodded knowingly, as if she had expected that answer. “Memory is fragile, but knowledge… knowledge can be regained. Here.” She reached under the counter and pulled out a massive, leather-bound book. Its cover was embossed with strange symbols, some familiar, some alien.

"The Tome of Arcana," she said, setting it before me. “This will guide you. Within it are the truths of the cards, and their reversals. Every choice you make will be reflected here, and every path will have a consequence. But beware: the cards are mirrors, and mirrors never lie—except when you do.”

I stared at the book, feeling the weight of it settle into my chest. The faint hum of the city outside seemed to quiet in anticipation.

"Three objects," she continued, “you must find three objects. They are the price of the Tower’s fall. Without them… the journey ends before it begins.”

I swallowed hard, gripping the bag tighter. “And if I fail?”

Her eyes darkened, shadows flickering across her face. “Then the fall is complete, and Vespera will pay the cost. But that… is your burden, not mine.”

I nodded, though I wasn’t sure if I understood. The Tome felt heavier in my hands than it should, as though it were aware of its own importance. I slipped it into the bag with the cards and the key

"Go," she said softly. “The first path begins where the light touches the shadow. Trust the cards, and trust no one completely.”

I left the shop, the bell jingling behind me, and stepped back into the fog. Each step felt both cautious and urgent, as if the city itself were holding its breath. The Tower card pressed against my side, a silent reminder that my world had collapsed—but somewhere, out there, the pieces were waiting for me.

And I had to find them.
