	The fog lifted slightly as I made my way toward the bank vault district, the streets quieter than the city I remembered—or thought I remembered. My head still throbbing , but the weight of the Tome of Arcana in my bag reminded me that every step counted. I had a goal now, however uncertain: find the first object and understand the cards.

The bank loomed ahead, dark and imposing despite the neon glow of the streets. I hesitated at the entrance, key and cash in hand, thinking, “This must be it. The first step. But what am I really opening?”

I pushed the door, and a faint chime echoed through the marble lobby. The guards were gone—either shift change or… something else. I ignored the unease curling in my stomach and made my way to the vault.

Inside the deposit box room, I located the box the Tome had hinted at. My hands trembled as I inserted the key. The lock clicked open with a smoothness that felt unnatural.

Inside lay a heavy brass locket, its surface intricately carved with a broken tower. My breath caught in my throat. I traced the engraving with my fingers.

"This… this must be it," I whispered. “The first object…”

Beneath the locket, something else shifted in the dim light: a Tarot card. I pulled it out carefully. The Empress (III).

I opened the Tome, flipping quickly to the section on The Empress. “Creation… fertility… genesis,” I read aloud, my voice low. “The genesis of the journey… of me?”

I stared at the locket again. It wasn’t just an object; it felt alive, waiting to be “nurtured,” just as the card said. My mind raced. “Nurtured… by what? By understanding? By light? By truth?”

A faint sound drew my attention. The vault door clicked—someone was approaching. I slipped the locket and card back into my bag just as a guard poked his head in.

"Sir? Everything okay in there?" the guard asked, brow furrowed.

"Yes… just… checking the lock," I said, forcing a calm I didn’t feel. My voice was steadier than I expected.

The guard grunted and left. I exhaled slowly, clutching the bag. The locket felt warmer now, as if acknowledging my understanding, my intent.

"Genesis," I whispered. “The first step… it’s mine. But only if I see it through.”

I stepped out of the vault and into the foggy streets, the city strangely quiet. The Tower card pressed in my mind, the Empress card in my hand, and the locket nestled in the bag.

I had begun.

But already, I felt it—the first stirrings of danger, the subtle awareness that someone, somewhere, was watching. The Tarot had marked my path, and now it was up to me to walk it.
